# Data-Processing-and-Storage-Assignment
Extra credit data processing and storage assignmnent

To run the code, download the python files and keep them in the same folder. keyValueDatabase.py is a library that contains the code for all of the transcational functions. database_test.py creates a database object and performs the same tasks as the example given in the assignment instructions. With the two files in the same folder, simply run database_test.py and it should give you proper results. You need to run the files with python 3.


As far as my opinion on this extra credit assignment becoming an assignment for future classes, I approve of the idea. I thought that it was very straightforward and clear as to what needed to be done. Because the instructions were comprehensive, I was able to get this assignment done in about an hour. I think that for an unskilled programmer this would take much longer, however it is definitely achievable for someone new to coding. I liked in this assignment how many examples were given as to how the code should perform.
